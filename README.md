# android-pipeline-library
Public repository for Android based Jenkins pipeline steps.
This library contains a few pipeline steps that can come handy when dealing with real devices in Jenkins pipelines.

## How to use in your own Jenkins setup
If you are not sure about how to use shared libraries, take a look at the [documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#using-libraries).

## Pipeline steps
All steps can be found under the vars folder.

### build
Builds and archives. If there is no argument supplied, archiving is skipped.
```groovy
build andArchive: '**/*.apk'
```
| argument      | description                                    | type      | mandatory |
| :-:           | :-:                                            | :-:       | :-:       |
| andArchive    | the path specifying the artifacts to archive   | String    | ✘         |

### lint
Lints and archives the lint results. If there is no argument supplied, archiving is skipped.
```groovy
lint andArchive: '**/lint-results*.*'
```
| argument      | description                                    | type      | mandatory |
| :-:           | :-:                                            | :-:       | :-:       |
| andArchive    | the path specifying the artifacts to archive   | String    | ✘         |

### test
Runs the unit tests, archives and publishes the test results. This step ensures that the results are archived/published even if the build fails.
If there is no argument supplied, archiving/publishing is skipped.
```groovy
test andArchive: '**/lint-results*.*'
```
| argument      | description                                    | type      | mandatory |
| :-:           | :-:                                            | :-:       | :-:       |
| andArchive    | the path specifying the artifacts to archive and publish to junit   | String    | ✘         |

### instrumentationTest
Runs the instrumentation tests, archives and publishes the test results.  This step ensures that the results are archived/published even if the build fails.
If there is no andArchive argument supplied, archiving/publishing is skipped.
The withLock argument requires the presence of the [Lockable Resources Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Lockable+Resources+Plugin).
The withScreenOn argument is set to true by default.
```groovy
instrumentationTest withScreenOn: true, withLock: 'android-device-farm', andArchive: '**/androidTest-results/connected/*.xml'
```
| argument      | description                                    | type      | mandatory |
| :-:           | :-:                                            | :-:       | :-:       |
| withScreenOn  | When set to true, turns on the device screens before running the instrumentation tests and turns them off when the instrumentation tests are finished. | Boolean | ✘ |
| withLock      | Acquires a lock for the duration of this step, so other steps can not interfere with the devices. | String | ✘ |
| andArchive    | the path specifying the artifacts to archive and publish to junit   | String    | ✘         |

### deviceCountShouldBe
Checks whether there is as many connected devices as should be. If the available device count does not match the expected count, this step fails the build.
```groovy
deviceCountShouldBe 4
```
| argument      | description                                    | type           | mandatory |
| :-:           | :-:                                            | :-:            | :-:       |
| expectedCount | the number of devices that should be connected | Integer/String | ✔         |

### rebootDevices
Reboots all connected devices or only a selection.
If no device list is specified, restarts all devices.
The default time unit is seconds.
The withLock argument requires the presence of the [Lockable Resources Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Lockable+Resources+Plugin).
It is advised to set the sleep argument with the withLock argument, so other builds wait until the devices had enough time to reboot.
```groovy
rebootDevices withLock: 'android-device-farm', sleep: 120
```
| argument      | description                                    | type      | mandatory |
| :-:           | :-:                                            | :-:       | :-:       |
| devices       | The list of device IDs returned by adb devices that should be rebooted. Defaults to all devices when omitted. | List<String> | ✘ |
| withLock      | Acquires a lock for the duration of this step, so other steps can not interfere with the devices. | String | ✘ |
| sleep         | The amount of time to wait before the lock is released. Useful to ensure that the devices had enough time to reboot completely, before other jobs can run tests on them, etc.   | Integer    | ✘         |
| unit          | The time unit. Valid values are: 'NANOSECONDS', 'MICROSECONDS', 'MILLISECONDS', 'SECONDS', 'MINUTES', 'HOURS', 'DAYS'. Defaults to 'SECONDS'. | String | ✘ |

### toggleScreen
Toggles the screens on all devices. If the screen was on, this step turns it of, if it was off, this step turns it on.
This step takes no arguments.
```groovy
toggleScreen()
```

### turnOnScreen
Turns on the screens on all devices. If the screen was already on, this step has no effect.
This step takes no arguments.
```groovy
turnOnScreen()
```

### turnOffScreen
Turns off the screens on all devices. If the screen was already off, this step has no effect.
This step takes no arguments.
```groovy
turnOffScreen()
```

## Utility classes
This library also comes with some utility classes that might be useful.

### Device
This class represents the rows of the `adb devices -l` command.
Given the following output:
```shell
List of devices attached
0123456789ABCDEF       device usb:339804160X
R32D203L00M            device usb:339804160X product:mantaray model:Nexus_10 device:manta
```

The corresponding Devices objects are:
```
Device(0123456789ABCDEF, device, 339804160X, null, null, null)
Device(R32D203L00M, device, 339804160X, mantaray, Nexus_10, manta)
```

### DeviceLister
This class provides methods to get information about the devices connected.
Don't forget to import the class.
```groovy
import com.github.pjozsef.DeviceLister

def deviceLister = new DeviceLister(env.ANDROID_HOME)

//print the output of adb devices -l
echo deviceLister.devicesRawVerbose()

//print the output of adb devices
echo deviceLister.devicesRaw()

//get information about the connected devices
//a List<Device> is returned
def devicesByState = deviceLister.devices()

//get the list of only those devices that are available (with the state of 'device')
//a List<Device> is returned
def availableDevices = deviceLister.availableDevices()
```

### DeviceCommander
This class provides an execute method that allows to run commands against all or only a subset of devices.
The execute method takes two parameters. The command string, which is mandatory. The result is a Map<String, String>, where the key is the adb assigned device ID, and the value is the std output of the command for that device.
Due to Jenkins limitations, an optional String -> () Closure must also be supplied if you also want to see the results logged to the build console log.
Don't forget the imports.
```groovy
import com.github.pjozsef.DeviceLister
import com.github.pjozsef.DeviceCommander

def devices = new DeviceLister(env.ANDROID_HOME).availableDevices()
def commander = new DeviceCommander(env.ANDROID_HOME, devices)

//print the battery percentage for the list of devices that were given in the constructor
def result = commander.execute("shell cat /sys/class/power_supply/battery/batt_attr_text | grep ^level"){
    echo it
}
//prints:
//Executing shell dumpsys battery | grep level on 12345678987876
//level: 94
//Executing shell dumpsys battery | grep level on 98765432123451
//level: 67

for(e in result){
    echo "$e.key -> $e.value"
}
//prints
//12345678987876 ->   level: 94
//98765432123451 ->   level: 67

```
